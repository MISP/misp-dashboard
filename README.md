# MISP-Dashboard
An experimental dashboard showing live data and statistics from the ZMQ of one or more MISP instances.

# Installation
- Launch ```./install_dependencies.sh``` from the MISP-Dashboard directory
- Update the configuration file ```config.cfg``` so that it matches your system
  - Fields that you may change:
    - RedisGlobal -> host
    - RedisGlobal -> port
    - RedisGlobal -> zmq_url
    - RedisGlobal -> misp_web_url
    - RedisMap    -> pathMaxMindDB

# Updating by pulling
- Re-launch ```./install_dependencies.sh``` to fetch new required dependencies
- Re-update your configuration file ```config.cfg```

:warning: Make sure no zmq python3 scripts are running. They block the update.

# Starting the System
:warning: You do not need to run it as root. Normal privileges are fine.

- Be sure to have a running redis server
    - e.g. ```redis-server --port 6250 &```
- Activate your virtualenv ```. ./DASHENV/bin/activate```
- Listen to the MISP feed by starting the zmq_subscriber ```./zmq_subscriber.py &```
- Start the dispatcher to process received messages ```./zmq_dispatcher.py &```
- Start the Flask server ```./server.py &```
- Access the interface at ```http://localhost:8001/```

# Debug

Debug is fun and gives you more details on what is going on when things fail.
Bare in mind running Flask in debug is NOT suitable for production, it will drop you to a Python shell if enabled, to do further digging.

Just before running ./server.py do:

```
export FLASK_DEBUG=1
export FLASK_APP=server.py
flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8001 # <- Be careful here, this exposes it on ALL ip addresses. Ideally if run locally --host=127.0.0.1
```

OR, just toggle the debug flag in start_all.sh script.

Happy hacking ;)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -n ZMQNAME, --name ZMQNAME
                        The ZMQ feed name

# Deploy in production using mod_wsgi

Install Apache's mod-wsgi for Python3

```bash
sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-wsgi-py3
```

Caveat: If you already have mod-wsgi installed for Python2, it will be replaced!

```bash
The following packages will be REMOVED:
  libapache2-mod-wsgi
The following NEW packages will be installed:
  libapache2-mod-wsgi-py3
```

Configuration file `/etc/apache2/sites-available/misp-dashboard.conf` assumes that `misp-dashboard` is cloned into `var/www/misp-dashboard`. It runs as user `misp` in this example. Change the permissions to folder and files accordingly.
